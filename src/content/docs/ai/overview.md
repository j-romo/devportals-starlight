# AI for DX

Enhancing Developer Experience with Intelligent Tools

Artificial Intelligence is becoming an essential part of the developer experience (DX), not just in applications but in the tooling that supports software development itself. In modern developer portals, AI technologies are helping streamline how developers interact with documentation, APIs, and support systems.

From chatbots that can answer technical questions in real time, to LLMs (Large Language Models) that generate code snippets on demand, AI is transforming static documentation into dynamic, responsive, and personalized developer experiences.

Developer portals can now leverage AI in several impactful ways:
- Automate code sample generation for multiple languages from API specifications.
- Auto-complete documentation or suggest improvements for better readability and usability.
- Enable natural language search across complex technical content.
- Provide context-aware chat support via AI-powered assistants.
- Perform error analysis and suggest fixes directly within the portal.

By integrating AI, dev portals are no longer just repositories of informationâ€”they become active, intelligent hubs that reduce friction and help developers get the answers, examples, and support they need faster than ever.
