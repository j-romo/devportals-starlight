As developer portals evolve, choosing the right markup language becomes crucial for maintaining scalable, collaborative, and future-proof documentation. This section explores the most popular markup languages used in technical writing today.

## Why Markup Languages Matter

Modern documentation requires more than just plain text. Technical writers need:

- **Version control compatibility** for collaborative workflows
- **Semantic structure** for consistent styling and accessibility
- **Tool ecosystem support** for automated publishing and integration
- **Developer adoption** for seamless team collaboration
- **Future portability** to avoid vendor lock-in

## Popular Markup Languages

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Markdown (.md)" icon="document">
		The most widely adopted markup language. Simple syntax, broad tool support, perfect for basic documentation needs.
		
		**Best for**: README files, basic docs, GitHub-based workflows
	</Card>
	
	<Card title="MDX (.mdx)" icon="react">
		Markdown with JSX components. Combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of interactive React components.
		
		**Best for**: Interactive docs, component libraries, modern web frameworks
	</Card>
	
	<Card title="reStructuredText (.rst)" icon="setting">
		Python's documentation standard. Rich semantic markup with powerful cross-referencing and extension capabilities.
		
		**Best for**: API documentation, Sphinx-based sites, Python projects
	</Card>
	
	<Card title="AsciiDoc (.adoc)" icon="open-book">
		Feature-rich markup language designed for technical documentation. More powerful than Markdown with book-quality output.
		
		**Best for**: Technical manuals, books, complex documentation projects
	</Card>

## Choosing the Right Markup Language

Your choice depends on several factors:

### Team & Ecosystem
- **Developer familiarity**: Markdown wins for general adoption
- **Existing toolchain**: Consider what your team already uses
- **Publishing platform**: Some platforms favor specific formats

### Content Complexity
- **Simple docs**: Markdown is sufficient
- **Interactive content**: MDX provides component integration
- **Cross-references**: reStructuredText excels at linking
- **Rich formatting**: AsciiDoc offers the most features

### Long-term Considerations
- **Migration paths**: How easy is it to convert between formats?
- **Tool ecosystem**: Will tools continue to support your choice?
- **Standardization**: Is the format actively maintained?

## Migration Strategies

When migrating between markup languages:

1. **Start with content audit** - What features do you actually use?
2. **Choose automated tools** - Don't convert manually
3. **Plan for content gaps** - Some features may not translate directly
4. **Test thoroughly** - Especially links and formatting
5. **Consider hybrid approaches** - You don't need to convert everything at once
