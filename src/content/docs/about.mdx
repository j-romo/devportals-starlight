# From Enterprise Docs to Developer Platforms

Welcome to my documentation platform where I share insights on building better developer portals.

I'm a senior technical writer who discovered that the future of documentation isn't just about writing—it's about building platforms that enhance developer experience at scale.

## My Journey
- **Enterprise Documentation**: Years managing complex docs platforms and workflows
- **Platform Evaluation**: Analyzing when to migrate from proprietary to open-source solutions  
- **Hands-on Building**: Creating demos across Astro, Next.js, and Docusaurus

This site chronicles that journey, with practical guides for teams making similar transitions.

## Current Projects
- **[DevPortals.Tech](/)** (this site): Astro Starlight documentation platform showcasing modern developer portal patterns, custom component overrides, and technical writing best practices
- **[Portfolio](https://portfolio.devportals.tech)**: Next.js SPA integrated as a subdomain, featuring GitHub API integration and responsive design
- **[PeanutButterAndJelly.ai](https://peanutbutterandjelly.ai)**: Astro frontend with Sanity Studio headless CMS demonstrating content-driven architecture
