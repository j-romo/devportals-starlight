# From Enterprise Docs to Developer Platforms

I'm a senior technical writer who discovered that the future of documentation isn't just about writingâ€”it's about building platforms that enhance developer experience at scale.

## My Journey
- **Enterprise Documentation**: Years managing complex docs platforms and workflows
- **Platform Evaluation**: Analyzing when to migrate from proprietary to open-source solutions  
- **Hands-on Building**: Creating demos across Astro, Next.js, and Docusaurus

This site chronicles that journey, with practical guides for teams making similar transitions.

## Current Projects
- **DevPortals.tech** (this site): Astro Starlight showcase
- **Next.js Demo**: MDX + API explorer integration  
- **Docusaurus Demo**: Multilingual docs with versioning
