As a senior technical writer who's spent years managing enterprise documentation platforms, I've seen the pain points that drive teams to migrate from proprietary solutions to open-source alternatives.

This site chronicles that journey and provides practical guidance for teams making similar transitions.

## Why Astro Starlight?

After evaluating multiple documentation frameworks, Starlight stood out for several reasons:

- **Performance**: Static site generation with minimal JavaScript
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent TypeScript support and hot reload
- **Flexibility**: Easy to extend and customize
- **Modern**: Built for the current web ecosystem

## What's Next?

I'm building additional demos in Next.js and Docusaurus to provide comprehensive framework comparisons for teams evaluating their options.

Stay tuned for more practical migration strategies and platform evaluations!
