When I started working on our developer portal migration, I didn't expect redirect configuration to become one of the most critical pieces of infrastructure. But as our documentation platform evolved—moving from legacy systems to a modern docs-as-code workflow—redirects became the safety net that prevented broken links and maintained trust with our developer community.

## The Challenge: Documentation That Never Stops Evolving

Developer portals are living platforms. Unlike traditional documentation that might see quarterly updates, our portal changes constantly:

- **Weekly content updates** from multiple technical writers
- **Monthly product releases** requiring new version branches
- **Quarterly restructures** as products evolve and merge
- **Annual migrations** between documentation platforms or frameworks

Each change risks breaking existing URLs that developers have bookmarked, linked to in Stack Overflow answers, embedded in tutorials, or integrated into their CI/CD pipelines. A broken documentation link isn't just an inconvenience—it's a broken promise to developers who depend on stable reference material.

## Why Redirects Matter in Docs-as-Code

The docs-as-code methodology brings tremendous benefits: version control, automated testing, collaborative editing through pull requests. But it also introduces new redirect challenges that traditional CMS platforms handled automatically:

### 1. File-Based Routing Creates URL Coupling

When documentation URLs map directly to file paths in your repository, renaming a file or reorganizing folders breaks URLs. In our migration from a legacy system to Astro Starlight, we couldn't just move files—we had to map every old URL to its new location.

### 2. Version Management Requires Redirect Strategy

Modern developer portals maintain multiple documentation versions simultaneously. When we deprecated v2.11 of our API docs, we needed to:
- Redirect users from `/docs/v2.11/*` to `/docs/current/*`
- Preserve the specific page they were viewing
- Ensure search engine rankings transferred to the new URLs

### 3. Content Restructuring Breaks Existing Links

As our product matured, we reorganized documentation from technology-centric sections to use-case-driven guides. Hundreds of pages moved. Without redirect rules, every external link, bookmark, and integration would have returned 404s.

## Redirect Strategies and Use Cases

Understanding when and how to implement redirects is essential for documentation platforms. Here are the most common scenarios where redirect strategies become critical:

### Pattern-Based Redirects for Version Management

When maintaining multiple documentation versions, wildcard patterns allow you to handle entire version trees with single rules. Using Netlify's syntax (`*` and `:splat`), you can redirect complete sections:

```toml
[[redirects]]
from = "/docs/v2.12/*"
to = "/docs/current/:splat"
status = 302
```

This single rule handles hundreds of pages. When users visit `/docs/v2.12/installation/guide.html`, they're automatically redirected to `/docs/current/installation/guide.html`—preserving their specific destination while moving them to the current version.

### Catch-All Redirects as Safety Nets

Catch-all redirects handle any URL not matched by more specific patterns, acting as fallback handlers to prevent 404 errors:

**Version-specific catch-all (rewrite):**
```toml
[[redirects]]
from = "/docs/api/v2.11/*"
to = "/docs/api/v2.11/:splat"
status = 200
```

This rewrite (status 200) ensures proper internal routing for all pages within a specific version without changing the URL in the browser—essential for Single Page Application routing.

**Global catch-all (redirect):**
```toml
[[redirects]]
from = "/docs/api/*"
to = "/docs/api/current/:splat"
```

This redirects any unmatched paths to the current version, acting as our ultimate safety net.

## Lessons Learned: Redirect Strategy for Developer Portals

### 1. Redirects Are Infrastructure, Not Afterthoughts

Redirect planning should happen **before** you restructure content, not after. In our docs-as-code workflow, redirect configuration lives in version control alongside the content:

```
docs-repo/
├── src/content/
├── netlify.toml  ← Redirect rules go here
└── README.md
```

Every pull request that changes URLs should include corresponding redirect rules. This treats redirects as first-class infrastructure, reviewed and tested like any other code change.

### 2. Order Matters: Specific Before General

We learned this the hard way. Redirect platforms process rules sequentially—the first match wins. Our initial configuration had the global catch-all at the top, which meant specific redirects never triggered.

**The correct structure:**
1. Specific page redirects (exact matches)
2. Version alias redirects
3. Feature-specific patterns
4. Version catch-alls (status 200 rewrites)
5. Global catch-all (last resort)

### 3. Choose the Right Status Code

Understanding HTTP status codes became crucial:
- **301 (Permanent)**: For content permanently moved or removed—tells search engines to update their indexes
- **302 (Temporary)**: For version aliases that might change—preserves SEO for the original URL
- **200 (Rewrite)**: For SPA routing—serves different content without changing the browser URL

We initially used 301 for everything, which hurt our SEO when we later needed to change redirect targets. Now we use 302 for version aliases and 301 only when content is truly gone forever.

### 4. Test in Deploy Previews

Netlify's deploy preview feature became essential for testing redirects before production:

```bash
# Every PR gets a preview URL
https://preview-branch-name--site-name.netlify.app
```

We created a redirect test checklist:
- ✅ Does the redirect reach the correct destination?
- ✅ Is the status code appropriate (301/302/200)?
- ✅ Are query parameters preserved?
- ✅ Does the redirect work from external referrers?

### 5. Monitor and Maintain

Redirects aren't set-and-forget. We monitor:
- **404 rates**: Spikes indicate missing redirect rules
- **Redirect hit counts**: Identify which old URLs still get traffic
- **Redirect chains**: Ensure we don't have A→B→C patterns that slow page loads

## Choosing the Right Platform for Redirect Management

Different hosting platforms handle redirects differently. The platform I work with uses file-based configuration that lives in version control alongside the documentation source. This approach fits naturally into docs-as-code workflows:

- **Configuration as code**: Redirect rules are reviewed in pull requests like any other change
- **Deploy preview testing**: Test redirects before they reach production
- **No server management**: Focus on documentation, not infrastructure maintenance
- **Readable syntax**: Technical writers can understand and modify redirect rules

Other platforms offer different tradeoffs—more powerful regex capabilities, multiple wildcards per rule, or programmatic control through serverless functions. The "best" platform depends on your specific needs:

- **Simple docs-as-code workflow?** File-based configuration platforms (Netlify, Vercel) work well
- **Complex pattern matching needs?** Traditional servers (Apache/Nginx) offer full regex power
- **High-scale distributed systems?** Cloud solutions (AWS CloudFront/Lambda@Edge) provide programmability

The key is choosing a platform that matches your team's workflow and technical capabilities, not necessarily the most feature-rich option.

## The Impact: What Good Redirects Enable

Implementing a comprehensive redirect strategy transformed how we approach documentation:

- **Restructure content confidently** - reorganize pages, merge sections, and deprecate versions without breaking existing links
- **Faster iteration** - no coordination needed with external teams who've linked to our docs
- **Better developer trust** - users always land on relevant content, even from years-old bookmarks
- **Sustainable evolution** - the documentation can grow and change without accumulating technical debt
- **True docs-as-code** - content changes flow through Git without worrying about URL stability

## Key Takeaways for Developer Portal Teams

If you're building or migrating a developer portal, treat redirects as critical infrastructure:

1. **Plan redirects before restructuring** - don't wait until after migration
2. **Version control your redirect config** - redirects are code, not server config
3. **Use wildcard patterns** - one rule can handle hundreds of URLs
4. **Implement catch-alls** - ensure users never hit 404s
5. **Test in preview environments** - catch problems before production
6. **Monitor redirect metrics** - 404 rates, redirect hits, chains
7. **Choose platforms that support docs-as-code** - file-based config beats UI-based config
8. **Document your redirect strategy** - future team members will thank you

## Looking Forward

Redirect management isn't glamorous work. It's invisible when it works correctly—which is exactly the point. Developers shouldn't think about redirects. They should just land on the page they need, regardless of which old URL they clicked.

As our developer portal continues evolving—and it will never stop evolving—redirects remain the safety net that lets us improve documentation without breaking trust. They're the infrastructure that makes docs-as-code workflows sustainable at scale.

For developer portals, broken links aren't just bad UX—they're broken promises. Redirect strategies ensure that when we promise stable documentation, we deliver.
